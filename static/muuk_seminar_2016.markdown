### Minimal model theorem and Feynman graphs for $A_\infty$ algebras
##### Friday 18. 3. 2016

####Abstract:

This week, we will continue developing the theory of strongly homotopy algebras. Using the definitions from
previous week, we describe how a minimal model can be constructed using Feynman-like sums. This is because the minimal
model can be thought of as on-shell correlation functions of a field theory associated to a (cyclic) strongly homotopy algebra.
