#Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and homotopy algebras.         


BRST and Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism
 play an important role in quantization of gauge theories. However, 
their relevance to various areas of mathematics has appeared recently. 
We will build the necessary background and explain their relevance to 
the theory of homotopy algebras and operads.
    We begin by reviewing the Batalin-Vilkovisky
 formalism and the master equation, from algebraic and geometric 
viewpoint. Then we explain how the master equation governs various 
homotopy algebras, like $L_\infty$ or $A_\infty$ algebras. These 
algebras, in turn, arise naturally when using operads. Therefore, 
we will see versions of the master equation coming from representations of operads, 
algebras over an operad.

### Introduction, BV operator as a dual of de Rham differential
##### Part I, Friday 26. 2. 2016

####Abstract:
In the first lecture, we give an overview and sketch the background from quantum field theory. 
Then we start with BV formalism from the algebraic viewpoint: Gerstenhaber brackets, BV algebras and master equation.

### Graded geometry and integration over Lagrangian submanifolds
##### Part II, Friday 4. 3. 2016

####Abstract:
 In the second lecture,  we will look at the geometry of BV formalism. The BV Laplacian
 in the context of graded manifolds is a divergence, so we will look at 
the generalization of Stokes theorem. This will enable us to see the 
gauge invariance as a consequence of the master equation.

### Strongly homotopy algebras in the coalgebra description
##### Part III, Friday 11. 3. 2016


####Abstract:
  This week, we take a closer look at homotopy algebras. We review the 
case of Lie algebras and then generalize, to L_\infty A_\infty algebras.
 Then we can define their morphisms and minimal models. Finally, we will
 explain the connection of these homotopy algebras to string field 
theory.

### Minimal model theorem and Feynman graphs for $A_\infty$ algebras
##### Part IV, Friday 18. 3. 2016

####Abstract:
This week, we will continue developing the theory of strongly homotopy algebras. Using the definitions from
previous week, we describe how a minimal model can be constructed using Feynman-like sums. This is because the minimal
model can be thought of as on-shell correlation functions of a field theory associated to a (cyclic) strongly homotopy algebra.
